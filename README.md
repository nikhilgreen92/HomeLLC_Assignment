Uploading the data into colab from downloaded files
Renaming the columns so that column names are easily comprehended.
Merging dataframes of monthly columns separately
Making dataframes of annual columns separately
Now merging annual dataframes.
Merging both the dataframes then cleaning the dataset with columns containing NaN values.
Generating CSV file for data preparation
EDA & Data Visualization of the dataset for easy understanding.
Then proceeding to making Linear Regression model.
Conclusion.
